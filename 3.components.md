# Functional Components Modern
Its a less complex and functional way of creating components, as we can see here we dont need to use Component from react and build a class and we also dont need to use the method render().

However we need to remember that to use multiple JSX expressions we either need to use a <div></div> or a fragment <></>
Also return needs paranthesis ()

Example
```jsx
function App() {
  
  return (
    <>
    <p>Hello world, this is a functional component</p>
    <ul>
      {
        [1, 2, 3].map(num => <li>{num}</li>)
      }
    </ul>
    </>
  )
}
```
# Class Components Old way
Same JSX rules aplies but the difference here is that we are now dealing with an object that is extended from the React component, so we need to use its rules, such as using Render() to render stuff and even construct to use props and `this.state`, it gets complicated.
```jsx
import React from 'react'

Class component - Old way, we need to import React to use Component
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <p>Hello world, this is a class component</p>
    )
  }
}
```
