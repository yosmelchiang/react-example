# What is VDOM
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM elements. React creates a virtual DOM tree whenever a component changes. It compares the new VDOM with the previous version (this process is called reconciliation) and calculates the difference (called a diff). Instead of re-rendering the entire DOM, React only updates the parts of the real DOM that have changed.

This makes React much faster than manipulating the DOM directly, which traditionally involves more expensive operations.

# React-DOM
ReactDOM is the library that connects React to the real browser DOM. It's the bridge between React components and the actual HTML elements on the page.

For example, ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root')) tells React to render the App component into a real DOM node with the id root.

In essence:
- React updates the Virtual DOM first.

- Then ReactDOM makes minimal, efficient updates to the real DOM based on the changes in the Virtual DOM.
