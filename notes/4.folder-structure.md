# Components
In order to create good folder structure we need to first ask ourselves about the `Relevance` and `Reusability` of this component.
1. Is this component specific to a single feature or page?
2. Will this component be reused across multiple parts of the application?
3. Is this component small and purely presentational or is it a container-like (manages logic and state)?


## src/components
If this component is going to be a general component that is going to be used in multiple files, we should place it in a folder called `components` inside our `src` folder.

This folder should contain reusable, general-purpose components that are shared across multiple features or pages such as `Buttons`, `Input`, `Prompts`, `Card` etc.

# Styles
Here we place global CSS stylesheets

# Pages
Here we place route-level components that we can use for routing used by `react-router-dom` like `Home.jsx`, `About.jsx`, `Contact.jsx` etc
