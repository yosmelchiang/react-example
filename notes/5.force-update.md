`forceUpdate` is used when we specifically need to re-render after changes has been made locally within our component. This is basically telling Render that we made some changes to the component and in order for React to pick these up, we need to re-render.

`forceUpdate` is only used in class components and cannot be used in functional components

We shouldnt rely too much on forceUpdate as its recommended to be avoided. Instead we shold use `this.props` and `this.state`in `render` method to re-render.
