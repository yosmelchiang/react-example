# useState
A react hook that lets us work with variables we can update with a setter function, updating a useState variable will automatically re-render our React app.

# import it from react
```js
import { useState } from "react";
```

# The useState function
Returns an array containing two things:
1. `State Value`: Value of any kind, can be a number, an array or whatever we initially choose it to be, we can leave it empty (undefined) or give it an initial value, an initial value is always recommended.
2. `State Function`: A function that lets you update the value. Calling it triggers a re-render.

# Destructuring
Now that we now what we get from useState, we can simply destructure its content and assign a name for our `value` and our `function`.
We do this by using destructuring
```js
const [listOfNumbers, setListOfNumbers] = useState([])
```

Here we have initialised our list of numbers as an empty array and now we can use setListOfNumbers to update it whenever

# Updating our state
Updating our list of numbers above is simple, its best to not mutate the original array (`listOfNumbers`), instead we make a copy of it and do whatever we want with it athen use the function `setListOfNumbers` to update the old array with the new one.

```js
const newArr = [...listOfNumbers] // We are making a new array, and copying the original listOfNumbers into it with the spread operator

newArr.splice(0, 1) // The first parameter of splice is the index of where we are modifying the array from, the second is how many elements we are removing, theres a third parameter, which is a replace value, in case we wanna replace it with something instead of removing

setListOfNumbers(newArr) // Now we are updating the original listOfNumbers with the new modified one
```
