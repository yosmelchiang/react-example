# useState
A react hook that lets us work with variables we can update with a setter function, updating a useState variable will automatically re-render our React app.

# import it from react
```js
import { useState } from "react";
```

# The useState function
Returns an array containing two things:
1. `State Value`: Value of any kind, can be a number, an array or whatever we initially choose it to be, we can leave it empty (undefined) or give it an initial value, an initial value is always recommended.
2. `State Function`: A function that lets you update the value. Calling it triggers a re-render.

# Destructuring
Now that we now what we get from useState, we can simply destructure its content and assign a name for our `value` and our `function`.
We do this by using destructuring
```js
const [listOfNumbers, setListOfNumbers] = useState([])
```

Here we have initialised our list of numbers as an empty array and now we can use setListOfNumbers to update it whenever

# Updating our state
Updating our list of numbers above is simple, its best to not mutate the original array (`listOfNumbers`), instead we make a copy of it and do whatever we want with it athen use the function `setListOfNumbers` to update the old array with the new one.

```js
const newArr = [...listOfNumbers] // We are making a new array, and copying the original listOfNumbers into it with the spread operator

newArr.splice(0, 1) // The first parameter of splice is the index of where we are modifying the array from, the second is how many elements we are removing, theres a third parameter, which is a replace value, in case we wanna replace it with something instead of removing

setListOfNumbers(newArr) // Now we are updating the original listOfNumbers with the new modified one
```

# Important to remember
- State is async - React batches state updates and re-renders later, so `setSTate` doesnt update immediately even though it feels like that, it just happens fast.

```js
setCount(count + 1);
console.log(count); // still shows old value!
```
[giste example](https://gist.github.com/yosmelchiang/466d2ea4c23d8c7abc79fa0f8bbdb3f1)

What happens:

Action:
1. We click we button
2. setCount(count + 1) is called
3. React schedules the state update, its not applied yet until the next render cycle
4. We console log the state, but a new render cycle hasnt started yet before the rest of this code is done
5. Once the rest of code is done we start a new render cycle

Render cycle:
1. Render re-renders the component App to get the new JSX
2. React compares the new JSX with the old one (reconciliation)
3. React renders the new App component that shows the Count: 1

- State is immutable - We should never modify state directly (e.g., no `state.push()` or `state = something`)
  - However, primitive values like numbers and strings are **immutable by nature**, so when we “change” them, we’re actually replacing the whole value, not mutating it, either way its good practice to treat them as immutable and not modify the original value.
