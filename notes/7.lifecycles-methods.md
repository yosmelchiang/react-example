# What a lifecycle is
The methods here are only used in class component

In react, a component goes through phases in its lifecycle, and we can use methods to mark certain stages/phases of this lifecycle and do specific things in those phases.

The order of a component lifecycles goes as follow:
- Constructor, initializes the state and binds methods
- render() - Returns the JSX to be rendered
- componentDidMount(): Invoked after the first time the component is rendered and added to the DOM
- componentWillUnmount(): Invoked before the component is being removed from the DOM

# componentDidMount
Is called when a component is finished rendering and places in the DOM.
This method is invoked only during the lifecycle of a component immidiately after the first render.
We can use this to do certain things upon the component is finished mounting on the DOM
Its useful for things like fetching data etc
```js
componentDidMount(){  
  // code to be executed
}
```
The code will run after the first render meaning once the component is mounter

Heres in a example doing a fetch
