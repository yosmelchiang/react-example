# useEffect
This one is used in functional components while componentDidMount and those methods are used in class components.

- By default it runs on every render, unless we specify a dependency array
- Takes two parameters
 - a callback function
 - a dependency array

## Import
```js
import { useEffect } from 'react';
```

## Syntax
```js
useEffect(fn, dependencies)
```

# Dependencies
We can control when the `useEffect` hook should run by passing a dependency array as a second argument, by default `useEffect` will run on every render unless a specified otherwise.

## No dependencies
```jsx
 useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Hello world");
  }); // No dependency array - runs on every render
```

This is in essence the same as using both `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` because not only will `useEffect` render first time the component was mounter but also on every update thereafter.

## Empty array
An empty array means itll just run after the first render isntead of every render, its just like `componentDidMount`
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Hello world once after the component mounts (like componentDidMount)");
}, []); // Empty array means it runs once after the first render
```

This is in essence the same as using `componentDidMount`, we just want `useEffect` to render first time when the component is finished mounting and not on updates.

## Dependencies
If we add dependencies, itll render if any of the listed dependencies have changed, meaning itll listen to any changes in the listed dependencies and if they are changed. Additionally, itll render the first time the component is mounter as well, just like `componentDidMount`

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Hello world right after Count changed");
}, [count]); // Runs whenever `count` changes

```

# componentWillUnmount
We can use this in useEffect aswell by returning a cleanup function inside our code logic.

Use cases
- remove event listeners
- cancel timers
- clear intervals

To achieve this we simply add this to our useEffect function
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Hello world once after the component mounts (like componentDidMount)");

  return () => {
   console.log("Cleanup before unmounting!"); // Similar to componentWillUnmount
  };

}, []); // Empty array means it runs once after the first render

```

# Good to know
- We can use multiple `useEffect` hooks per components, compared to class lifecycle methods which are limited to one per class component
